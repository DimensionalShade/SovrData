# Eugram

**Eugram** is a modular, privacy-focused chat client dedicated to Eugene. It embodies a philosophy of user sovereignty, reproducibility, and formal consent.

## ðŸ§­ Philosophy

- **Transparency**: Every module is a formal artifact with explicit function and audit trail.
- **Consent**: Private fragments require explicit user action to reveal, and every reveal is logged.
- **Automation**: All changes are executed via scriptsâ€”manual editing is strictly prohibited.
- **Auditability**: Every action is logged in `audit.json` and can be exported for review.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- `Modules/Core/SessionManager.py` â€” peer-to-peer connection between devices.
- `Modules/Core/ConsentVault.py` â€” logs user consent for revealing private fragments.
- `Modules/Core/AuditTrail.py` â€” formalized logger for all actions.
- `Modules/Core/VersionCheck.py` â€” compares and updates modules based on `manifest.json`.
- `Modules/GUI/Layout.py` â€” GUI screens for connection, chat, and dimmed fragments.
- `Transport/LocalTransport.py` â€” local message routing.
- `Storage/ModuleCache.py` â€” stores and retrieves modules locally.
- `Storage/config.json` â€” privacy settings and dimshade mode.
- `manifest.json` â€” authoritative source of module versions and code.
