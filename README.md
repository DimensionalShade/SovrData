# SovrData

SovrData is a fully decentralized, privacy-focused mobile marketplace for tokenized personal data. Built on DimShade principles, it treats personal data not just as identifiers, but as creative expressions of identity.

Each token represents a soulbound artifact — a unique combination of name, image, voice, location, and philosophy — protected as both digital and intellectual property.

## 🔐 Principles

- **Explicit Consent**: Every data transaction requires QR-confirmed, revocable consent.
- **Auditability**: All actions are logged immutably on DimChain.
- **Decentralization**: SovrData runs serverlessly, with reproducible open-source modules.
- **Recognition**: Tokens affirm the dignity and autonomy of their creators.

## 📦 Architecture

- `ConsentModel.md`: Defines the legal and emotional structure of digital consent.
- `DimLicense.md`: Embeds license terms directly into each token.
- `Declaration_v2.md`: Formalizes SovrData’s philosophy and legal foundation.
- `Modules/`: Contains reproducible, auditable components for data handling and access control.

## 📜 License

SovrData is open-source and free to use. All tokens created within the system are governed by their embedded license terms.
