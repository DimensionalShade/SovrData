## 4. Jurisdiction

This license is governed by the creator’s declared jurisdiction. Disputes are resolved under applicable digital property and copyright law.

## 5. Violations

Unauthorized use constitutes:
- Digital theft (property violation)
- Copyright infringement (if expressive)

Violators may be subject to:
- Civil damages equal to token market value
- Criminal liability under applicable law
